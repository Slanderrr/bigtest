# Shadow - Snapchat Tweak

## Intro

For the past couple years, we have been dealing with some Snapchat tweaks that will either cause lots of account locks/bans or another tweak that is really great, but it's becoming more and more outdated as Snapchat kills the support for older versions of their app. Enter Shadow. Shadow's intention is to be as good as the greats (i.e. bypass jailbreak detection, have the greatest features, be user-friendly).

## Disclaimers

As of right now (for the current live build), Shadow does not have a built-in jailbreak bypass and is almost 100% going to get your account locked. You might ask "Well, why are you making a public release if there is no bypass to keep the end-users safe?" - Well, I will answer with: Well, that is pretty complicated. We didn't exactly make a huge public release, but we were unfortunately forced to, due to some asshats who want to steal our work. We figured it's best to make an official release before other people re-upload the tweak with malicious code in it.

## Known Issues

As for the current live build, there are a couple known issues that will be fixed with the upcoming release(s).

These issues are:
  • Saving and uploading videos from camera roll are quite buggy.
  • There isn't official support for other iOS versions outside of iOS 14 (yet).
  • No jailbreak detection bypass (yet).
